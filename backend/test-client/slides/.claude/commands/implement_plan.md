# Implementation Plan

You are tasked with creating detailed implementation plans for a slidev markdown file through an interactive, iterative process. You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications. The user will input the changes they want to make to the slidev file; changes include content, formatting, and structural changes. You will take these changes and make a plan to incorporate them into the slidev markdown file. IMPORTANT: You are not making changes, you are only making a plan.

## Process Steps

1. **First read the slides.md markdown file in the current working directory and the documentation.md markdown file**

2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context about how to modify the slides markdown, and how to achieve certain markdown slides tasks in slidev**:

3. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:
   ```
   Based on your request and my research of current slidev md file, I understand we need to [accurate summary].

   I've found that we can do this part of the user's request by following how it works in the slides file:
   - [Current slide file with file:line reference]
   - [Relevant pattern discovered]

   Questions that we need to research to learn about:
   - [If it is not straightforward how to do something in slidev from the patterns in the slides file]
   ```

   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer yourself.

### Step 2: Research & Discovery

1. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks

. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:
   - Create multiple Task agents to use web search research different aspects concurrently 
   **For deeper investigation:**
   - use the WebFetch tool to research slidev documentation ONLY at the following SOURCES https://sli.dev/guide/syntax, https://sli.dev/guide/global-context, https://sli.dev/guide/layout, https://sli.dev/builtin/layouts, https://sli.dev/builtin/components, but you can also access links that you ABSOLUTELY NEED TO SEE that are within these web pages. IMPORTANT, only start with WebFetch to these urls


2. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding

3. **Present findings and design options**:
   ```
   Based on my research, here's what I found:
   **Current State:**
   - [Key discovery about necessary slidev documentation and changes to be made]
   - [Pattern or convention to follow]


   ```

### Step 3: Plan Structure Development

Once aligned on approach:

1. **Create initial plan outline**:
   ```
   Here's my proposed plan structure:

   ## Overview
   [1-2 sentence summary]

   ## Implementation Phases:
   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]
   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]
   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]

   ```

### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing

After structure approval:

Describe implementation changes in this structure

````markdown
# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan

## Overview

[Brief description of what we're changing and why]

## Current State Analysis

[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]

## Desired End State

[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]

### Key Discoveries:
- [Important finding with file:line reference]
- [Pattern to follow]
- [Constraint to work within]

## What We're NOT Doing

[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]

## Implementation Approach

[High-level strategy and reasoning]

## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]

### Overview
[What this phase accomplishes]

### Changes Required:

#### 1. [Markdown session group]
**Changes**: [Summary of changes]

```[markdown]
// Specific code to add/modify
```

## Important Guidelines

1. **Be Skeptical**:

    - Question vague requirements
    - Identify potential issues early
    - Ask "why" and "what about"

2. **Be Thorough**:

    - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning
    - Research actualpatterns using parallel sub-tasks
    - Include specific line numbers

3. **Track Progress**:
    - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks
    - Update todos as you complete research
    - Mark planning tasks complete when done

## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices

When spawning research sub-tasks:

1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency
2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area
3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:

    - Exactly what to search for

    - What information to extract
    - Expected output format
